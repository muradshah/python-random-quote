Responsive is better than fast
It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
Get busy living or get busy dying
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough
If you want to live a happy life tie it to a goal not to people or things
In order to write about life first you must live it
The unexamined life is not worth living
Turn your wounds into wisdom
I like criticism. It makes you strong
The healthiest response to life is joy
This is programaticly added qoute
